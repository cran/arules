# arules 1.6-0 (2/28/2018)

    renamed breaks to be consistent with cut in R-base.

* Added discretizeDF to apply discretization to all numeric 
  columns in a data.frame.

  does some more checking, making the specification of templates easier.

  quality data.frame.
* Added %oin% to find transactions/itemsets that ONLY contain certain items.

## Bug Fixes
* Improved PROTECT placement in C source code.

   (reported by lordbitin).

    equation for least contradiction (reported by Feng Chen). 


# arules 1.5-2 (03/12/2017)

## New Features
* apriori: maxtime = 0 disables the time limit. 
* is.subset/is.superset uses now fast and memory efficient C code 
   for sparse computation (contributed by Ian Johnson). 
   sparse = TRUE is now the default. Note that the result is now a 
   sparse matrix.

# arules 1.5-1 (01/23/2017)

## New Features

* Added interest measure maxConf.
* is.significant now supports in addition to Fisher's exact test,
  the chi-squared test.
* interest measures Fisher's exact test and chi-squared 
  (using significance = TRUE) can now produce p-values for
  substitutes (with complements = FALSE).
* Added function DATAFRAME for more control over coercion to data.frame 
  (e.g., use separate columns for LHS and RHS of rules).

## Bug Fixes

* Error message for sorting with an unknown interest measure.
* abbreviate works now for rules correctly.

## Internal Changes

* Added registration code for native routines. This requires R 3.3.2.

# arules 1.5-0 (09/23/2016)

## Major Changes

* apriori uses now a time limit set in the parameter list with 
  maxtime. The default is 5 seconds. Running out of time or maxlen results 
  in a warning. The warning for low absolute support was removed.

## Bug Fixes

* is.redundant now also marks rules with the same confidence as redundant.
* plot for associations and transactions produces now a better 
  error/warning message.
* improved argument check for %pin%. Warns now for multiple patterns 
  (was an error) and give an error for empty pattern.
* inspect prints now consistently the index of rules/itemsets using brackets 
  and starting from 1.

# arules 1.4-2 (08/06/2016)

## Bug Fixes

* is.redundant returned !is.redundant (reported by brisbia)

  (reported by ddessommes).

# arules 1.4-0 (03/18/2016)

## New Features

* The transaction class lost slot transactionInfo (we use the 
  itemsetInfo slot now). Note that you may have to rebuild some 
  transaction sets if you are using transactionInfo.
* interestMeasure: performance improvement for "improvement" measure.
* sort: speed up sort by always sorting NAs last.
* head: added method head for associations for getting the best rules 
  according to an interest measure faster than sorting all the 
  associations first.
* abbreviate is now a S4 generic with S4 methods.

## Bug Fixes

* combining item matrices with 0 rows (reported by C. Buchta).
* itemLabel recoding in is.subset (reported by sjain777). 
* NAMESPACE export for %in%
* is.redundant: fixed and performance improvement.
* Groceries: fixed typo in dataset.

# arules 1.3-1 (12/13/2015)

* APparameter: confidence shows now NA for frequent itemsets.

# arules 1.3-0 (11/11/2015)

## New Features

* removed deprecated WRITE and SORT functions.
* subset extraction: added checks, handles now NAs and recycles for logical.
* read.transactions gained arguments skip and quote and some defaults for
  read and write (uses now quotes and no rownames by default) have changed.
* itemMatrix: coersion from matrix checks now for 0-1 matrix with a warning.
* APRIORI and ECLAT report now absolute minimum support.
* APRIORI: out-of-memory while rule building does now result in an error and
  not a memory fault.
* aggregate uses now 'by' instead of 'itemLabels' to conform to 
      aggregate in base.

  (by C. Buchta). 
    
# arules 1.2-1 (09/20/2015)

## New Features

* Added many new interest measures.
* interestMeasure: the formal argument method is now called measure 
  (method is now deprecated).
* Added Mushroom dataset.
* Moved abbreviate from arulesViz to arules.

## Bug Fixes

* fixed undefined behavior for left shift in reclat.c 
  (reported by B. Ripley)

# arules 1.2-0 (09/14/2015)

## Major Changes

* added support for weighted association rule mining (by C. Buchta):
    - transactions can store weights a column called "weight" in 
        transactionInfo.
    - support, itemFrequency and itemFrequencyPlot gained a parameter
        called weighted.
    - weclat extends eclat with transaction weights.
    - hits can be used to calculate weights from transact ions.
* We are transitioning to internally use consistently data.frames 
  with the correct number of rows for quality, itemInfo, 
  transactionInfo and itemsetInfo. These data.frames possibly have 
  0 columns.
* arules uses now testthat (tests are in tests/testthat).

## New Features

* sort can now sort by several columns (used to break ties) in quality. 
  It also gained an order parameter to return a permutation vector
  (order) instead.
* inspect gained parameters setStart, setEnd, itemSep, ruleSep and
  linebreak to control output better.
* read.transactions now ignores empty items (e.g., caused by trailing 
  commas and leading or trailing white spaces).
* labels now returns not a list but consistent labels for objects       
  (transactions, itemMatrix, rules, itemsets, and tidLists). 
* tidLists has now an inspect method, gained coercion from "list", and
  has now a replacement method for dimnames(). 
* Coercion from itemMatrix to matrix results now in a logical matrix.
* fixed as(transactions, "data.frame"). The column names do now have
  no prefix (except if transactionInfo contains an item called "items").
* transactions has now its own dimnames function which correctly returns 
  transactionID from transactionInfo as rownames.
* replacement method for dimnames() checks now dimensions.
* item labels are now internally handled as character using 
  stringAsFactor = FALSE in data.frames and not AsIs with I(character).
* rules can now have no item in the RHS.

## Bug Fixes

* fixed missing row labels for is.subset().
