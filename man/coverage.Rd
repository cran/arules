\title{Calculate coverage for rules}
\description{
   Provides the generic function and the needed S4 method to
   calculate the coverage (support of the left-hand-side) of rules.
   }
\usage{
coverage(x, transactions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ the set of rules. }
  \item{transactions}{ the data set used to generate 'x'. Only needed if
  the quality slot of 'x' does not contain support and confidence. }
}
\details{
  Coverage is calculated from the rules quality measures 
  (support and confidence) stored in the quality slot or, if these
  values are not present, as the 
  support of the LHS.
}
\value{
   A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x} containing
   the coverage values for the sets in \code{x}.
}

data("Income")

## find and some rules (we only use 5 rules here) and calculate coverage
rules <- apriori(Income)[1:5]
quality(rules) <- cbind(quality(rules), coverage = coverage(rules))
