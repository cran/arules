Changes in version 1.1-1 (1/16/2014)
    * is.superset/is.subset now makes sure that the two arguments conform using

    * is.superset/is.subset returns now a matrix with appropriate dimnames
    * bug fix: fixed dimname bug in as(..., "dgCMatrix") for tidLists
    * image: labels are now passed on correctly.
    * tidLists has now c(). 

Changes in version 1.1-0 (12/10/2013)
    * bug fix: reuse in now passed on correctly in interestMeasures 
	      (bug reported by Ying Leung)

        ngCMatrix instead
    * coercion from ngCMatrix to itemMatrix and transactions is now possible
