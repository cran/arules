Changes in version 1-3-0 (11/11/2015)
    * removed deprecated WRITE and SORT functions.
    * ruleInduction: bug fix for missing confidence values and better checking 
      (by C. Buchta). 
    * subset extraction: added checks, handles now NAs and recycles for logical.
    * read.transactions gained arguments skip and quote and some defaults for
      read and write (uses now quotes and no rownames by default) have changed.
    * itemMatrix: coersion from matrix checks now for 0-1 matrix with a warning.
    * APRIORI and ECLAT report now absolute minimum support.
    * APRIORI: out-of-memory while rule building does now result in an error and
      not a memory fault.
    * aggregate uses now 'by' instead of 'itemLabels' to conform to 
      aggregate in base.
    
Changes in version 1-2-1 (09/20/2015)
    * Added many new interest measures.
    * interestMeasure: the formal argument method is now called measure 
      (method is now deprecated).
    * Added Mushroom dataset.
    * Moved abbreviate from arulesViz to arules.
    * fixed undefined behavior for left shift in reclat.c 
      (reported by B. Ripley)

Changes in version 1-2-0 (09/14/2015)
    * added support for weighted association rule mining (by C. Buchta):
        - transactions can store weights a column called "weight" in 
            transactionInfo.
        - support, itemFrequency and itemFrequencyPlot gained a parameter
            called weighted.
        - weclat extends eclat with transaction weights.
        - hits can be used to calculate weights from transact ions.
    * sort can now sort by several columns (used to break ties) in quality. 
      It also gained an order parameter to return a permutation vector
      (order) instead.
    * inspect gained parameters setStart, setEnd, itemSep, ruleSep and
      linebreak to control output better.
    * read.transactions now ignores empty items (e.g., caused by trailing 
      commas and leading or trailing white spaces).
    * labels now returns not a list but consistent labels for objects       
      (transactions, itemMatrix, rules, itemsets, and tidLists). 
    * tidLists has now an inspect method, gained coercion from "list", and
      has now a replacement method for dimnames(). 
    * Coercion from itemMatrix to matrix results now in a logical matrix.
    * fixed as(transactions, "data.frame"). The column names do now have
      no prefix (except if transactionInfo contains an item called "items").
    * transactions has now its own dimnames function which correctly returns 
      transactionID from transactionInfo as rownames.
    * fixed missing row labels for is.subset().
    * replacement method for dimnames() checks now dimensions.
    * item labels are now internally handled as character using 
      stringAsFactor = FALSE in data.frames and not AsIs with I(character).
    * rules can now have no item in the RHS.
    * We are transitioning to internally use consistently data.frames 
      with the correct number of rows for quality, itemInfo, 
      transactionInfo and itemsetInfo. These data.frames possibly have 
      0 columns.
    * arules uses now testthat (tests are in tests/testthat).

Changes in version 1.1-9 (7/13/2015)
    * More work on namespace.
    * Fixed tests.

Changes in version 1.1-7 (6/29/2015)

    * Fixed namespace imports for non-base default packages.

Changes in version 1.1-6 (12/07/2014)
    * dissimilarity method "pearson" is now set to 1 (max) for neg. 
      correlation. Also added phi correlation coefficient.
    * discretize method "cluster" accepts now ... passed on to k-means
	    (e.g., for nstart)
    * merge for itemMatrix checks now for conformity
    * as(..., "transactions"): binary attributes are now translated into items
      only if TRUE.

    * Import drop0 from Matrix

Changes in version 1.1-4 (7/25/2014)
    * C code: fixed problem in error message generation in apriori and eclat

    * C code: removed some unused variables.

Changes in version 1.1-3 (6/17/2014)
    * Fixed dependency on XML and pmml
    * the interest measure chi-squared does now also report p-values

    * interestMeasure consistently returns now NA if not defined for a 
        certain rule

Changes in version 1.1-2 (2/21/2014)
    * discretize gained the parameter ordered.
    * itemwise set operations itemUnion, itemSetdiff and itemIntersect added.
    * validObject checks now rules more thoroughly
    * aggregate removes duplicate items from the lhs

Changes in version 1.1-1 (1/16/2014)
    * is.superset/is.subset now makes sure that the two arguments conform using 
        recode (number and order of items)
    * is.superset/is.subset returns now a matrix with appropriate dimnames
    * bug fix: fixed dimname bug in as(..., "dgCMatrix") for tidLists
    * image: labels are now passed on correctly.
    * tidLists has now c(). 

Changes in version 1.1-0 (12/10/2013)
    * bug fix: reuse in now passed on correctly in interestMeasures 
	      (bug reported by Ying Leung)
    * direct coercions from and to dgCMatrix is no longer supported use 
        ngCMatrix instead
    * coercion from ngCMatrix to itemMatrix and transactions is now possible
